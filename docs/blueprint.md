- Fully responsive, mobile-first card-based structure. Use generous spacing, clean section dividers, and sticky navigation for easy access—ensure seamless switching between provider/buyer dashboards.
- Pair ‘Belleza’ (sans-serif) for headlines/tabs/buttons with ‘Alegreya’ (serif) for descriptions, service details, and policy text for a balanced, premium feel.
- Rounded corners, micro-animations (button hover, modals), blur effects for overlays, shadow border on cards, and clear call-to-action (CTA) buttons.
- Follow latest B2B/B2C SaaS dashboard best practices for conversion and usability. Visual hierarchy should mirror top Indian marketplaces.
